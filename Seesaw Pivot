Assume that you've a long board which is made up of individual links having different weights.

--------- - Structure

123247633 - Weights

We can replace a link with a pivot to get a balanced seesaw. In this case

--------- - Structure

12324*633 - Weights with * representing pivot point

As in the example If we replace the link with weight 7(at index 5, zero based indexing) with a pivot, we get a perfectly balanced see-saw.

For an arbitrarily weighted see saw, find the pivot link index

Input Format

Input has two lines, first line the length of the see-saw(number of links). Second is a space separated weights of each link 9 1 2 3 2 4 7 6 3 3

Constraints

3 ≤ n ≤ 1000
It is guaranteed that a solution always exists.
Output Format

Index of the link where the pivot should be placed 5
