Let's split the natural Numbers into three types:

Exact: A number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is an Exact number.

Scarce: A number n is called Scarce if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n. Example sum of proper divisors of 10 is 1 + 2 + 5 = 8, which makes 10 a Scarce number

Plentiful: A number n is called Plentiful if the sum of its proper divisors is more than n. Example sum of proper divisors of 12 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, which means that 12 is a Plentiful number

Given n, find the sum of all the Plentiful numbers less than or equal to n
